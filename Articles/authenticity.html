          <h3>AUTHENTICITY AND AIRPLANES</h3>

<h4> How online content creators are alienated from their labour.</h4>


<p>Over the past few years, there has been a growing discussion online about content creators suffering from burnout, or from feeling or seeming fake and inauthentic. I would like to propose that these feelings are caused by the systems and institutions that control our online lives, and the ways that those systems are alienating us from our emotional labor. If this is the case, how do we reclaim that labour, and what can we achieve once we do?</p>

<p>I am an online content creator, and if you’re reading this there’s a good chance that you are too. This isn’t because I know who you are, it’s because when I say “content creator” I am not just talking about youtubers or the like, I’m talking about anybody who creates media for a platform. We could go deeper into defining what media is, but I’m going to use a very broad definition, which is: Anything that people make with the intent of showing another person. This means, whether they realize it or not, when a friend takes a snapchat, when a grandmother uploads family photos to facebook, or when a dissatisfied customer writes a yelp review, they are all content creators. With this in mind, consider that what I’m going to write about in these articles most definitely apply to you and everyone you know.</p>

<p>But first we’re going to talk about flight attendants.</p>

<h5>1. THE BASICS OF EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</h5>

<p>In 1983, coincidentally the same year that the internet was established, Arlie Russell Hochschild published The Managed Heart: The Commercialization of Human Feeling. In it Hochschild described the complex systems of emotional management, and the ways that corporations use these systems to control their workers. Specifically, Hochschild was focused on flight attendants working for Delta Airlines.</p>

<p>Emotional management is a natural process that we all use to varying degrees in our day-to-day life. While there are risks involved, they are risks that are under our control. The real problems start to reveal themselves when a person, such as a flight attendant or a content creator, is encouraged to manage their emotions for their work.</p>

<p>In the case of the flight attendants, passengers had come to expect genuine care, natural smiles, enthusiastic attention, and potentially even sexual interest as a result of advertising messages from a variety of different airlines. The flight attendants, had been trained to provide for these expectations. To do this required emotional management. But in this case, Delta Airlines was the entity performing the management for its workers. Because of this, Delta controlled the emotional truths of their brand for their customers by managing the emotional display of their workers. Hochschild writes:</p>

<p>“Display is what is sold, but over the long run display comes to assume a certain relation to feeling. As enlightened management realizes, a separation of display and feeling is hard to keep up over long periods. A principle of cognitive dissonance is at work… When display is required by the job, it is usually feeling that has to change; and when conditions estrange us from our face, they sometimes estrange us from feeling as well.” - (Hochschild, page 90)</p>

<p>The ways in which the employer or institution encourages this change of feeling is usually through methods of deep acting. With Delta, trainers would ask flight attendants to imagine the cabin as their living room, and the passengers as their guests. Or,  more insidiously, they would ask the flight attendants to imagine drunken passengers, who would often sexually harass them, as “like a child” and deserving of care. By changing the emotional truth of their interactions, the flight attendants could better manage their emotions in order to act as if the cabin were their living room, or as if the drunk were like a child, and therefore deliver the authentic smiles that were advertised and demanded.</p>

<p>However, doing these emotional maneuvers for a prolonged period of time under stressful conditions brings with it some occupational hazards. As the cognitive dissonance between the feeling and act takes its toll, the flight attendants would come to feel confused about where their true emotions started, and their commodified emotions ended. Hochschild defines “three hard questions” that people doing emotional labor must ask of themselves in order to resolve this issue.</p>

<p>“How can I feel really identified with my work role and with the company without being fused with them?”
“How can I use my capacities when I am disconnected from those I am acting for?.”
“If I’m doing deep acting for an audience from whom I'm disconnected how can I maintain my self esteem without becoming cynical?”</p>

<p>To resolve the first question, Hochschild suggests the worker develop the ability to depersonalize interactions between themselves and the customer. This includes ignoring criticism and compliments. Hochschild explains that the flight attendants who have mastered this skill “Talk about their feelings not as spontaneous natural occurrences, but as objects they have learned to govern and control” - (Hochschild, page 133) By truly accepting criticism or compliments from the passengers they would be giving credence to the passengers opinion over them, which gives the passenger control over who the flight attendant is. This is kinda how it works in our day-to-day lives, we are to some extent defined by the people we associate with and how they perceive us, but for the flight attendant this is a hazard.</p>

<p>The second question is meant to resolve the issue of seeming “phony” or inauthentic to the customer. In the case of flight attendants, being phony was not only seen as bad acting, but was stigmatized as a personal flaw. We can draw a parallel to how content creators are similarly criticized for the quality of their productions. If you are disconnected from your customer, be it passenger or audience, you run the risk of being perceived as inauthentic. You can temporarily rely on surface acting, but ultimately you must resolve this disconnection in some way.</p>

<p>The third question is resolved by redefining the job so that “phoniness”, the inauthenticity, is desirable. Hochschild quotes a passage from a flight attendant’s union magazine article as an example:
“We deal in the illusion of good service. We want passengers to think they are having a good time. It is dangerous to take any of the abuse seriously.” - (Hochschild, page 135. Emphasis mine.)</p>

<p>This method removes responsibility for the phoniness away from the worker and to the institution instead. Hochschild writes “It is no longer the sincere smile that is phony, it is the illusion of a good time that is phony” - (Hochschild, page 135) Some content creators do this by actively cultivating an inauthentic personality for comedic purposes, or by actively calling into question the environment they exist in.</p>

<p>Unfortunately though, for many content creators, these are questions you may not be able to answer.</p>

<h5>2. HOW CONTENT CREATORS ARE NOT EXACTLY FLIGHT ATTENDANTS</h5>

<p>Hochschild frequently makes a distinction between emotional labour that is used in a commercial setting and emotional labour that is used for art and therapy, however for content creators in the modern context of social media, the distinction between art, therapy, and work begins to break down. When we try to apply the “three hard questions” and their associated tactics to the role of an online content creator,  things get messy. Hochschild writes:</p>

<p>“In acting, the illusion starts out as an illusion. In everyday life, that definition is always a possibility and never quite a certainty. On stage the illusion leaves as it came, with the curtain. Off stage, the curtains close, too, but not at our bidding, not when we expect, and often to our dismay. On stage illusion is a virtue. But in real life, the lie to oneself is a sign of human weakness, of bad faith. It is far more unsettling to discover that we have fooled ourselves than to discover that we have been fooling others.” - (Hochschild, Page 47)</p>

<p>For many online content creators, the line between acting and real life is blurred, the role that they put on for their job is “themselves” or a characterized version of themselves. They may believe that they are always acting authentically and thereby not performing emotional labor, because they are not acting as anyone other than themselves. Because of this, they may not notice the dissonance forming between their actions and their feelings until it’s too late.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the content creator more than likely will not realize that an institution is even influencing their behavior. But many platforms subtly do this through their content algorithms, creator guidelines, the culture that the site cultivates, and reward systems such as Likes Comments and Subscribers or Upvotes or Retweets or whatever. The way that these come together to influence the content creator may not be intentional or understood by the site designers either, though the site owners certainly benefit from this system because the content creators are the ones driving traffic to their sites, and as they become more and more connected to the site they will drive more and more traffic and new users to the site. The content creator may believe that their productions and marketing efforts are for the benefit of their own careers, but in a way they have been coerced into doing (probably unpaid) labor for their platform. There may also be secondary forces influencing the emotion work of the content creator, such as a sponsor, or a collective of other creators, or the specific trends and social standards of a scene or movement that they are a part of.</p>

<p>And most importantly the customer that a content creator is performing for is remote, anonymous, and potentially even dehumanized by the content creator through the screen and with alienting labels such as “trolls” or “fans”. It is a possibility that the customer may be a bot and not a human, or a human with multiple accounts, or some combination of the two. In addition to all of this, the power dynamics between class, gender, and race, may not be immediately recognizable to the content creator as they would be in the airplane cabin. While the content creator may be able to depersonalize criticisms of their content or insults to their character, they may feel very proud of their work and accept praise without second thought to what it is doing to their self-concept.</p>

<p>All of these factors complicate or obscure the nature of the emotional labor that is being performed by the content creator - by you and me. And if we are unaware of all of this then we will not be able to answer Hochschild’s three hard questions and successfully distinguish between our real selves and our personas in order to perform our labor sustainably.</p>

<p>The  long term consequences of this can be seen in the case of Logan Paul. A successful lifestyle blogger and influencer who made national news after recording a video with a dead body in the infamous Japanese Suicide Forest. The evolution of Paul’s personal brand and how it lead to that critical moment has been discussed a lot online, but The Existential Horror of Logan Paul by youtuber Big Joel is my favorite take on the subject. In Logan Paul’s apology video, So Sorry, he says “What we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned, the reactions you saw on tape were raw, they were unfiltered, none of us knew how to react, or how to feel.” It might be easy to blame what happened to Logan Paul on a lack of authenticity, but that’s not what happened. What we saw was authentic, or at least some form of authenticity, it was just the type of authenticity that youtube encourages its creators to cultivate and broadcast. Logan Paul just ended up in a situation where that form of authenticity was inappropriate, and was emotionally ill-equipped to handle it properly. It’s as if the flight attendants continued to deliver drinks and smiles to worried passengers in the event of a plane crash. The difference is that the flight attendants know what to do during a disaster and Logan Paul did not.</p>

<h5>3. WHAT TO DO DURING A PLANE CRASH</h5>

<p>Hochschild discussed authenticity a little bit in their book, but only that it was in increasingly high demand, and that that demand also made true authenticity harder to come by. They do not discuss what authenticity is or should be. Perhaps they just figured that we would know it when we saw it, and that it was something that should come naturally to us. But whatever authenticity was, it has been replaced by something else. Real authenticity has been replaced by the type of authenticity that Logan Paul has, the type that isn’t useful during a plane crash. And I don’t know if you’ve noticed but the plane is crashing. Undoing the global climate epidemic has a deadline that we probably can’t meet, Neo-Nazis and the Alt-Right are becoming more and more powerful, people are more divided than ever, people are poorer than ever, people are more depressed and anxious than ever, and we need real authenticity now more than ever. But what even is it?</p>

<p>In Brené Brown’s 2011 Ted Talk about vulnerability, she explains that “Vulnerability is the key to authenticity”. She describes vulnerability as “The core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness” but also as “the birthplace of joy, creativity, belonging, and love”. When I first saw Brown’s talk this shocked me. I realized in that moment that Brown’s concept of authenticity was a phenomena that elicited deep and meaningful human connection, and that this was dramatically different from the “authenticity” that is cultivated by content creators and marketers.</p>

<p>Brown suggests that this form of authenticity either comes naturally to a person, or it would involve significant emotional turmoil and intense therapy over a long period of time in order to develop it. This is unfortunate because It’s not something that comes naturally to me, Brown spends much of her talk explaining how it doesn’t come naturally to her, and my guess is that it doesn't come naturally to you either.</p>

<p>If only there was a way that we could cultivate true authenticity in our work and with our interactions with others, perhaps we could begin taking steps towards solving our problems, big and small. That’s not to say that the solution to our problems is connection and kindness, but we can not even begin to discover and implement solutions until we have made that connection with each-other. The plane is crashing, and panicking won’t help, and neither will singing Kum Ba Yah, but we can’t stop the plane from crashing if we can’t agree that we’re in a plane.</p>

<p>What I’m going to suggest we do may sound like I’m suggesting we sign Kum Ba Yah together, but understand that it is only the first step in a long process of healing.</p>

<h5>4. AUTHENTICITY IN ACTION</h5>

<p>Marshall B. Rosenberg’s Nonviolent Communication is a method of conflict management that seeks to build understanding and trust instead of finding compromises. The process of nonviolent communication (NVC) is remarkably similar to the processes of emotional management that was used on flight attendants, and to a subtler extent content creators, but, instead of driving a wedge of inauthenticity between the worker and customer (or more importantly the worker and their self), it fosters empathy and connection. Doing this, requires the people involved to clearly express their observations, feelings, needs, and requests in a way that does not use what Rosenberg refers to as “Life-Alienating-Language.”  which is basically language that dehumanizes others, impedes our ability to understand each other, or removes our responsibility and agency from the situation.</p>

<p>I’ve been practicing NVC for a couple months now and It’s easier said than done, but it’s also helped me a lot. NVC requires us to be intensely vulnerable with other people, usually other people that we don’t like or are having trouble with. It requires us to try to understand our emotions and the emotions of others, and then test that understanding with them. All of this is hard stuff to do. But when it is done - things change.</p>

<p>Right now, I’d like to focus on how NVC can be used to resolve internal conflicts because, in a way, being disconnected from authenticity is an internal conflict. My hope is that by using NVC we can take back the emotional labour that we’ve been alienated from, escape the hollow systems of extrinsic rewards such Likes and Subscriber counts, recover from burnout, produce work that we’re truly proud of, make deeper connections with our audience and online communities, and maybe even stop the plane from crashing. The important thing here though isn’t NVC specifically, it’s the process of reclaiming our emotional labour that's important. If you know of a different method of reconnecting with your authenticity and reclaiming your emotional labour, I’d love to know what it is, because admittedly NVC isn’t perfect. It’s complicated, its awkward, its slow. But right now it's the best option I know of, and I’m willing to put up with its flaws in order to overcome mine.</p>

<p>The first step is to re-contextualize everything that we have to do or need to do or should do, into things that we choose to do or want to do. Rosenberg believes that phrases like “I have to go to work” or “I should have done something better” are ways of ignoring our own agency and pushing responsibilities for our actions away from us. The things that we “have to do” are really just the things that we do that don’t align with, or that we haven’t connected to, our internal needs and values. This is very similar to how flight attendants were told to think of the airplane cabin as if it were their living room, and the passengers as if they were guests. It is a form of deep acting. The difference here though is that we are the ones in control of this process, not Delta or the websites that we use to host our content.</p>

<p>The next step is to recognize why we want to do those things. Through this you may uncover the things you value, but you may uncover that your motivations were for money, or for approval, to escape punishment, or to avoid shame and guilt, or to satisfy a sense of duty. To Rosenberg, these motivations are toxic. In particular, I want to focus on the motivation of gaining approval, as this is one that I think all content creators will relate to. Rosenberg writes: </p>

<p>“I find it tragic that we work so hard to buy love and assume that we must deny ourselves and do for others in order to be liked. In fact, when we do things solely in the spirit of enhancing life, we will find others appreciating us. Their appreciation, however, is only a feedback mechanism confirming that our efforts had the intended effect.” (NVC p138-139)</p>

<p>Rosenberg suggests that we try and cut out the things we do in our life that we do for toxic reasons, or that we connect them to better reasons that align with our values and enrich the lives of others. For some of us, that might mean we need to stop being content creators, I hope that this isn’t the result of this exercise for you, because for me, there are a lot of good important reasons to do what I do, the desire for money or approval just gets in the way and distracts me from those true authentic reasons. There is an intrinsic value in being creative, no matter what form that creativity takes.</p>

<p>More than likely though, you’re going to discover things you do  that aren’t your content creation. Probably your job, or other responsibilities that you have and don’t want. Rosenberg makes it sound easy to just quit these things, but the reality is, there are things that we genuinely HAVE to do that we do not have a choice over. For example, I don’t particularly like that I have to make money and participate in capitalism, if I didn’t though, I would probably starve, or I would be exploiting the goodwill of those around me who still do what they have to do. So while I can’t entirely cut that out of my life, I can try and minimize my engagement and avoid the things that I find toxic about it. Rosenberg writes:</p>

<p>“When we speak a language that denies choice, we forfeit the life in ourselves for a robotlike mentality that disconnects us from our own core… As radical as it may seem, it is possible to do things only out of play.” - (NVC, P 140)</p>

<p>I think Rosenberg fails to recognize their own privilege here, but living a life where you do things only out of play is a worthwhile goal to strive towards, and it’s a worthwhile goal to help others achieve as well. Once we stop using the language and systems that deny our agency, we can take steps to reconnecting with our own emotions and the emotions of others. Human connection and communication is so often heralded as the social good that the internet and social media provides us, but it is so often also the thing that we build systems to limit and avoid. Rosenberg writes:</p>

<p>“We also cultivate self-compassion by consciously choosing in daily life to act only in service to our own needs and values rather than out of duty, for extrinsic rewards, or to avoid guilt, shame, and punishment. If we review the joyless acts to which we currently subject ourselves and make the translation from “have to” to “choose to,” we will discover more play and integrity in our lives.” (Rosenberg, page 140)</p>

<p>There's a lot more to NVC than this, and in the next articles we will be revisiting Rosenbergs ideas and applying them to other situations that we face as content creators. In the rest of this series I want to explore the ways in which we can use our influence as content creators, as people, to rediscover authenticity, rebuild human connection, and reclaim our labour. The systems that control our lives are powerful - but through understanding how they work and using the same techniques for good we can take back some of that power.</p>
